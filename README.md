# Django Ecommerce Store Copy
DISCLAIMER: Copy of django ecommerce project from YouTube

Most important things to me there to learn and review/look up later:
  - Cart Functionality (via AJAX and Django Session)
  - Custom User (by extending Django BaseUser)
  - Django MPTT (here usef for category and subcategory or products)
  - PayPal Payment Setup
